# Generic interface

The reason you should rather use the generic interface is that the generic interface is supported by all model types in `COBREXA`, while the internal model structure of each model type varies considerably. For example, `MATModel`s store the stoichiometric matrix directly, so `mat_model.mat["S"]` would return the stoichiometric matrix. However, `JSONModel`s do not do this, so `json_model.m["S"]` would throw an error. The `COBREXA` way of doing this is to use the generic interface, i.e. `stoichiometry(json_model)` and `stoichiometry(mat_model)` always return the stoichiometric matrix. 

Note, it is possible that the matrix returned by `stoichiometry` is not exactly the same __between__ models. The order of the reactions (columns) and metabolites (rows) may vary from model type to model type, although they are consistent __within__ each model type. So `stoichiometry(json_model)` will return a stoichiometric matrix where the columns correspond to the order of reactions listed in `reactions(json_model)` and the rows corresponds to the order of metabolites listed in `metabolites(json_model)`. The column/reaction and row/metabolite order from the `JSONModel` is not *necessarily* consistent with the stoichiometric matrix returned by `stoichiometry(mat_model)`. This is a minor note, but could cause confusion.
