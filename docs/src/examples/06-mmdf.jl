# # Thermodynamic models

# Here we will solve the max min driving force analysis problem using the
# glycolysis pathway of *E. coli*. In essence, the method attempts to find
# metabolite concentrations (NB: not fluxes) that maximize the smallest
# thermodynamic driving force through each reaction. See Noor, et al., "Pathway
#thermodynamics highlights kinetic obstacles in central metabolism.", PLoS
#computational biology, 2014, for more details.

# To do this, we will first need a model that includes glycolysis, which we can
# download if it is not already present.

# ## Running basic max min driving force analysis

# If a reference flux is not specified, it is assumed that every reaction in the
# model should be included in the thermodynamic model, and that each reaction
# proceeds in the forward direction. This is usually not intended, and can be
# prevented by inputting a reference flux dictionary as shown below. This
# dictionary can be a flux solution, the sign of each flux is used to determine
# if the reaction runs forward or backward.

# ## Using a reference solution

# Frequently it is useful to check the max-min driving force of a specific FBA
# solution. In this case, one is usually only interested in a subset of all the
# reactions in a model. These reactions can be specified as a the
# `reference_flux`, to only compute the MMDF of these reactions, and ignore all
# other reactions.

# It is most convenient to pass a flux solution into `reference_flux`, but

# included in the resultant thermodynamic model. Otherwise, remove them from
# reference flux input.
