# Enzyme constrained models require parameters that are usually not used by
# conventional constraint based models. These include reaction specific turnover
# numbers, molar masses of enzymes, and capacity bounds.

import AbstractFBCModels as A

### Reaction turnover numbers

# Here we will use randomly generated turnover numbers for simplicity. Each
# reaction in a constraint-based model usually has gene reaction rules
# associated with it. These typically take the form of, possibly multiple,
# isozymes that can catalyze a reaction. A turnover number needs to be assigned
# to each isozyme, as shown below.

using Random

reaction_isozymes = Dict{String,Dict{String,Isozyme}}() # a mapping from reaction IDs to isozyme IDs to isozyme structs.
for rid in A.reactions(model)
    grrs = A.reaction_gene_association_dnf(model, rid)
    isnothing(grrs) && continue # skip if no grr available
    haskey(ecoli_core_reaction_kcats, rid) || continue #src
    for (i, grr) in enumerate(grrs)
        d = get!(reaction_isozymes, rid, Dict{String,Isozyme}())
        # each isozyme gets a unique name
        d["isozyme_"*string(i)] = Isozyme( # Isozyme struct is defined by COBREXA
            gene_product_stoichiometry = Dict(grr .=> fill(1.0, size(grr))), # assume subunit stoichiometry of 1 for all isozymes
            kcat_forward = (100 + 50 * rand()) * 3600.0, # forward reaction turnover number units = 1/h
            kcat_backward = (100 + 50 * rand()) * 3600.0, # reverse reaction turnover number units = 1/h
        )
        d["isozyme_"*string(i)] = Isozyme( #src
            gene_product_stoichiometry = Dict(grr .=> fill(1.0, size(grr))), #src
            kcat_forward = ecoli_core_reaction_kcats[rid][i][1] * 3600.0, #src
            kcat_backward = ecoli_core_reaction_kcats[rid][i][2] * 3600.0, #src
        )
    end
end

#!!! warning "Turnover number units"
#    Take care with the units of the turnover numbers. In literature they are
#    usually reported in 1/s. However, flux units are typically mmol/gDW/h,
#    suggesting that you should rescale the turnover numbers to 1/h if you
#    want to use the traditional flux units.

### Enzyme molar masses

# Similarly, we will randomly generate enzyme molar masses for use in the enzyme
# constrained model.

gene_molar_masses = Dict(gid => 20 + 40 * rand() for gid in A.genes(model))
gene_molar_masses = ecoli_core_gene_product_masses #src

#!!! warning "Molar mass units"
#    Take care with the units of the molar masses. In literature they are
#    usually reported in Da or kDa (g/mol). However, as noted above, flux
#    units are typically mmol/gDW/h. Since the enzyme kinetic equation is
#    `v = k * e`, where `k` is the turnover number, it suggests that the
#    enzyme variable will have units of mmol/gDW. The molar masses come
#    into play when setting the capacity limitations, e.g. usually a sum
#    over all enzymes weighted by their molar masses: `e * mm`. Thus, if
#    your capacity limitation has units of g/gDW, then the molar masses
#    must have units of g/mmol (= kDa).

### Capacity limitation

# The capacity limitation usually denotes an upper bound of protein available to
# the cell.

total_enzyme_capacity = 0.1 # g enzyme/gDW

### Running a basic enzyme constrained model

ec_solution = enzyme_constrained_flux_balance_analysis(
    model,
    reaction_isozymes,
    gene_molar_masses,
    [("total_proteome_bound", A.genes(model), total_enzyme_capacity)];
    modifications = [set_optimizer_attribute("IPM_IterationsLimit", 10_000)],
    unconstrain_reactions = ["EX_glc__D_e"],
    optimizer = Tulip.Optimizer,
)

#src these values should be unique (glucose transporter is the only way to get carbon into the system)
@test isapprox(ec_solution.objective, 3.2105477675077743, atol = TEST_TOLERANCE) #src
@test isapprox(ec_solution.total_proteome_bound, 0.1, atol = TEST_TOLERANCE) #src

### Building a model incrementally

# create basic flux model
m = build_flux_balance_model(model)

# create enzyme variables
m += :enzymes^enzyme_variables(model)

# constrain some fluxes and enzymes manually
m.fluxes.EX_glc__D_e.bound = (-1000.0, 0.0) # undo glucose important bound from original model
m.enzymes.b2417.bound = (0.0, 0.1) # for fun, change the bounds of the protein b2417

# attach the enzyme mass balances
m = add_enzyme_constraints!(
    m,
    reaction_isozymes,
    gene_molar_masses,
    [("total_proteome_bound", A.genes(model), total_enzyme_capacity)];
    fluxes = m.fluxes, # mount enzyme constraints to these fluxes
    enzymes = m.enzymes, # enzyme variables
)

# solve the model
ec_solution = optimized_constraints(
    m;
    objective = m.objective.value,
    optimizer = Tulip.Optimizer,
    modifications = [set_optimizer_attribute("IPM_IterationsLimit", 10_000)],
)
