# In this notebook we use the max-min driving force analysis (MMDFA) to find
# optimal concentrations for the metabolites in glycolysis to ensure that the
# smallest driving force across all the reactions in the model is as large as
# possible. For more information, see Flamholz, Avi, et al.  "Glycolytic
# strategy as a tradeoff between energy yield and protein cost.", Proceedings
# of the National Academy of Sciences 110.24 (2013): 10039-10044.

# the standard Gibbs free energy change of biochemical reactions take place at
# constant pH, so proton concentration should not change to make the analysis
# behave reasonably; likewise we just assume that reactions occur in relatively
# stable aqueous environments, hence water excluded too.

#md # !!! tip "Directions of reactions"
#md #     Be careful when constructing models for MMDFA, the reaction directions in the model
#md #     and thermodynamic data need to be consistent with the overall flux
#md #     direction implied by the model. For example, in BiGG, `LDH_D` is written
#md #     `lac__D + nad ⟷ h + nadh + pyr` and the associated ΔrG'⁰ is 23.6803 kJ/mol.
#md #     For MMDFA no flux is calculated, so you need to write the reaction
#md #     in the direction of flux, i.e. `h + nadh + pyr ⟶ lac__D + nad` with ΔrG'⁰ as
#md #     -23.6803 kJ/mol.
