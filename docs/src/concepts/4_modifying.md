# Modifying and saving the models

Making a small modification to the model and reanalyzing them is often a useful
way to explore how the constraints work together, and to inspect the degrees of
freedom in the model.

With `COBREXA.jl`, you have two main choices of making model modifications:
- you can manually change the model structures (i.e. permanently change the
  data in of your `model` variable)
- you can use special arguments of analysis functions that allow you to make
  the modifications in a declarative way and "on the fly", without having to
  manually interact with the model

!!! tip "Notebook available"
    The available notebooks demonstrate
    [model export and serialization](../notebooks/1_loading_converting_saving.md)
    and various model modifications
    ([1](../notebooks/3_basic_stdmodel_usage.md),
    [2](../notebooks/4_basic_core_coupled_usage.md),
    [3](../notebooks/5_basic_stdmodel_construction.md)).

## Manual modifications

Certain model types, including [`CoreModel`](@ref) and [`StandardModel`](@ref),
are built from mutable `structs` that you are free to modify as you want.

[`CoreModel`](@ref) consists of sparse matrices and vectors that describe the
model precisely. For example, modifying a bound of the reaction is as simple as
writing to the `.xl` or `.xu` (**l**ower and **u**pper bound for **x**) vectors
in the structure:
```
using COBREXA
m = load_model(CoreModel, "e_coli_core.xml")
m.xl[3] = 0.0
```

The available field names can be listed using e.g. `fieldnames(CoreModel)`, or
more conveniently by employing the completion in the shell:
```
julia> m.   # press [Tab]
S    b     c     mets  rxns  xl    xu
```

With `CoreModel`, you may need to find the proper metabolites by identifier.
For that, you may examine the [`reactions`](@ref) and [`metabolites`](@ref) of
the model, e.g. using
```
indexin(["M_nadh_c", "M_co2_e"], metabolites(m))
```
...which will return the numeric indexes of NADH and CO₂ metabolites. These can
be used to, e.g., change the "balance" of the metabolites in the model:
```
m.b[64] = -1      # model will be losing 1 flux unit of CO₂
```
...or to modify existing reaction (here with index 5) directly in stoichiometry matrix:
```
m.S[5,8] = -1
m.S[5,64] = 1
```

While this works well if you are used to working with matrix-like
representations of the model, it is not really convenient if you want to change
the reactions and models in an easy way. [`StandardModel`](@ref) is structured
in a much more user-friendly way, which makes the manual modifications easier.

In particular, [`StandardModel`](@ref) consists of dictionaries of
[`Reaction`](@ref), [`Metabolite`](@ref) and [`Gene`](@ref) objects that may be
modified and indexed directly using their names. That way, the above
modifications may be written in a cleaner, semantic and declarative fashion, as
follows:

```
m = load_model(StandardModel, "e_coli_core.xml")
m.reactions["R_TPI"].lb = 0.0                         # change lower bound of the reaction to 0
m.reactions["R_GLNS"].metabolites["M_nadh_c"] = -1.0  # update stoichiometry
m.reactions["R_GLNS"].metabolites["M_co2_e"] = 1.0
...
```

There are other functions that may be used to change the `StandardModel` in a
more systematic way. See the documentation of [`add_reaction!`](@ref),
[`add_metabolite!`](@ref), [`add_gene!`](@ref), [`remove_reaction!`](@ref),
[`remove_metabolite!`](@ref), [ [`remove_gene!`](@ref),
and the [Model construction functions](@ref) reference section for more
examples.

## Analysis modifiers

Some analysis functions, including [`flux_balance_analysis`](@ref) and
[`flux_variability_analysis`](@ref), accept a special argument `modifications`,
which is a list of descriptions of small changes that should be applied to the
model before modification.

These include:
- [`change_objective`](@ref) that sets a new optimization objective
- [`change_optimizer`](@ref) that chooses a different `JuMP.jl` optimizer for
  the analysis
- [`change_optimizer_attribute`](@ref) that can set various optimizer
  parameters
- [`change_constraint`](@ref) that changes the flux bounds of a reaction
- [`knockout`](@ref) that disables reactions that depend on genes
- [`add_crowding_constraints`](@ref) that adds crowding constraints to the model
- [`add_moment_constraints`](@ref) that adds moment constraints to the model
- [`add_loopless_constraints`](@ref) that adds loopless (thermodynamic) constraints to the model

This way, you can easily check out the model state when maximizing the rate of
"TALA" (transadenolase A) reaction:

```
m = load_model(StandardModel, "e_coli_core.xml")
flux_balance_analysis_dict(
  m, GLPK.Optimizer;
  modifications=[change_objective("R_TALA")])
```

...or knock out a gene combination that disables the transadenolase A
completely (see `m.reactions["R_TALA"].grr`):
```
flux_balance_analysis_dict(
  m, GLPK.Optimizer;
  modifications=[knockout(["G_b0008", "G_b2464"])])
```

...or do both at once-- knock out some other genes, and try to maximize the
transadenolase A reaction rate:
```
flux_balance_analysis_dict(
  m, GLPK.Optimizer;
  modifications=[
    knockout(["G_s0001"]),
    change_objective("R_TALA"),
  ])
```

## Exporting the modified models in native formats

Manually modified models can be exported in standard formats so that they can
be examined in other environments, or just made accessible for publication.

`COBREXA.jl` supports export of MATLAB-like and JSON models. Simply use
[`save_model`](@ref):

```
save_model(m, "myModel.json")
save_model(m, "myModel.mat")
```

The function automatically guesses the appropriate model format to write into
the file from the file extension. If required, you can choose the model format
manually by using [`save_json_model`](@ref) and [`save_mat_model`](@ref).


## Using `Serialization` for quick & efficient model storage

If you save the model "just for yourself", such as for the use in an
immediately following analysis, it may be inconvenient (and unnecessarily
inefficient) to encode and decode the models to and from the external format.
Moreover, certain model types (such as [`CoreModelCoupled`](@ref)) cannot be
fully represented in all model formats, thus increasing the chance for
accidental data loss.

Instead of that, we recommend using the `Serialization` package. It provides a
straightforward way to save _any_ Julia data structure to the disk, using a
very efficient data format that can be written to and read from the disk very
quickly.

With any model in `m`, you can write it to disk as follows:
```
using Serialization
open(f -> serialize(f, m), "myModel", "w")
```
...and read it back with:
```
m = deserialize("myModel")
```

One great advantage of `Serialization` is speed -- models with millions of
reactions are usually loaded and saved with minimal overhead in less than a
second.

!!! warning "Limits of `Serialization`"
    Serialized models are great for quickly exchanging data objects between
    analysis steps. The avoided need for re-encoding can save you a great deal
    of analysis time that can be used for better purposes. Despite that, do not
    rely on the stability of the serialized format -- it often changes between
    Julia versions, and the data stored in one version may not open easily
    after an upgrade. In short, use serialized data within one workflow, and
    use standard and stable external formats for publishing and storing the
    data beyond the scope of a single analysis workflow.
