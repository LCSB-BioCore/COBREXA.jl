A predicate that matches reaction identifiers that look like
exchange or biomass reactions, given the usual naming schemes in common model
repositories. Exchange reactions are identified based on matching prefixes in
the set `exchange_prefixes` and biomass reactions are identified by looking for
occurences of `biomass_strings` in the reaction id.

Also see [`find_exchange_reactions`](@ref).

```

filter(looks_like_exchange_reaction, reactions(model)) # returns Strings

A predicate that matches reaction identifiers that look like biomass reactions.
Biomass reactions are identified by looking for occurences of `biomass_strings`

exchanges (from [`looks_like_exchange_reaction`](@ref)) will not match.
