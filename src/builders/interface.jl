Join multiple constraint tree modules with interfaces into a bigger module with
an interface.

Modules are like usual constraint trees, but contain an explicitly declared
`interface` part, marked properly in arguments using e.g. a tuple (the
parameters should form a dictionary constructor that would generally look such
as `:module_name => (module, module.interface)`; the second tuple member may
also be specified just by name as e.g. `:interface`, or omitted while relying
on `default_interface`).

Interface parts get merged and constrained to create a new interface; networks
are intact with disjoint variable sets.

Compatible modules with ready-made interfaces may be created e.g. by
[`flux_balance_constraints`](@ref).

`ignore` may be used to selectively ignore parts of interfaces given the
"module name" identifier and constraint path in the interface (these form 2
parameters passed to `ignore`). Similarly, `bound` may be used to specify
bounds for the new interface, if required.
