A constraint tree that bound the values present in `signed` to be sums of pairs
of `positive` and `negative` contributions to the individual values.

Keys in the result are the same as the keys of `signed` constraints.

Typically, this can be used to create "unidirectional" fluxes
together with [`unsigned_negative_contribution_variables`](@ref) and
[`unsigned_positive_contribution_variables`](@ref).
