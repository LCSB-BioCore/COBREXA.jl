$(TYPEDSIGNATURES)

Return a `MatrixModel` representing the community model of `models` joined through their
exchange reactions and metabolites in the dictionary `exchange_rxn_mets`, which maps
exchange reactions to their associated metabolite. These exchange reactions and metabolites
link model metabolites to environmental metabolites and reactions. Optionally specify
`model_names` to append a specific name to each reaction and metabolite of an organism for
easier reference (default is `species_i` for each model index i in `models`). Note, the
bounds of the environmental variables are all set to zero. Thus, to run a simulation you
need to constrain them appropriately. All the other bounds are inherited from the models
used to construct the community model.

If `biomass_ids` is supplied, then a community model is returned that has an extra reaction
added to the end of the stoichiometric matrix (last column) that can be assigned as the
objective reaction. It also creates biomass "metabolites" that can be used in this objective
reaction. In the returned mode, these biomass metabolites are produced by the reaction
corresponding to `biomass_ids` in each model respectively. Note, this reaction is
unspecified, further action needs to be taken to specify it, e.g. assign weights to the last
column of the stoichiometric matrix in the rows corresponding to the biomass metabolites.

To further clarify how this `join` works. Suppose you have 2 organisms with stoichiometric
matrices S₁ and S₂ and you want to link them with `exchange_rxn_mets = Dict(er₁ => em₁, er₂
=> em₂, er₃ => em₃, ...)`. Then a new community stoichiometric matrix is constructed that
looks like this:
```
            _      er₁  er₂  er₃  ...  b_
           |S₁                           |
           |   S₂                        |
        em₁|                             |
S   =   em₂|                             |
        em₃|                             |
        ...|                             |
        bm₁|                             |
        bm₂|_                           _|

```
The exchange reactions in each model get linked to environmental metabolites, `emᵢ`, and
these get linked to environmental exchanges, `erᵢ`. These `erᵢ` behave like normal single
organism exchange reactions. When `biomass_ids` are supplied, each model's biomass reaction
produces a pseudo-metabolite (`bmᵢ`). These can be weighted in column `b`, called the
`community_biomass` reaction in the community model, if desired. Refer to the tutorial if
this is unclear.

m1 = load_model(core_model_path)
m2 = load_model(MatrixModel, core_model_path)

Add `model` to `community`, which is a pre-existing community model with exchange reactions
and metabolites in the dictionary `exchange_rxn_mets`. The `model_name` is appended to each
reaction and metabolite, see [`join_with_exchanges`](@ref). If `biomass_id` is specified
then a biomass metabolite for `model` is also added to the resulting model. The column
corresponding to the `biomass_id` reaction then produces this new biomass metabolite with
unit coefficient. The exchange reactions and metabolites in `exchange_rxn_mets` must already
exist in `community`. Always returns a new community model because it is more efficient than
resizing all the matrices.

No in-place variant for `MatrixModel`s exists yet.
