    module COBREXA

COnstraint Based Reconstruction and EXascale Analysis. COBREXA provides
functions for construction, modification, simulation and analysis of
constraint-based metabolic models that follows the COBRA methodology.

COBREXA is built as a front-end for the combination of `AbstractFBCModels.jl`
(provides the model I/O), `ConstraintTrees.jl` (provides the constraint system
organization), `Distributed.jl` (provides HPC execution capability), and
`JuMP.jl` (provides the solvers).

See the online documentation for a complete description of functionality aided
by copy-pastable examples.

To start quickly, load your favorite JuMP-compatible solver, use
[`load_model`](@ref) to read a metabolic model from the disk, and solve it with
[`flux_balance`](@ref).
