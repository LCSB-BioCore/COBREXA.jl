$(TYPEDSIGNATURES)

Perform a max-min driving force analysis using `optimizer` on the `model` with
supplied reaction standard Gibbs energies in `reaction_standard_gibbs_free_energies`.

The method was described by by: Noor, et al., "Pathway thermodynamics highlights
kinetic obstacles in central metabolism.", PLoS computational biology, 2014.

`reference_flux` sets the directions of each reaction in `model`. The scale of
the values is not important, only the direction is examined (w.r.t.
`reference_flux_atol` tolerance). Ideally, the supplied `reference_flux` should
be completely free of internal cycles, which enables the thermodynamic
consistency. To get the cycle-free flux, you can use
[`loopless_flux_balance_analysis`](@ref) (computationally complex but gives
very good fluxes), [`parsimonious_flux_balance_analysis`](@ref) or
[`linear_parsimonious_flux_balance_analysis`](@ref) (computationally simplest
but the consistency is not guaranteed).

Internally, [`log_concentration_constraints`](@ref) is used to lay out the
base structure of the problem.

Following arguments are set optionally:
- `water_metabolites`, `proton_metabolites` and `ignored_metabolites` allow to
  completely ignore constraints on a part of the metabolite set, which is
  explicitly recommended especially for water and protons (since the analyses
  generally assume aqueous environment of constant pH)
- `constant_concentrations` can be used to fix the concentrations of the
  metabolites
- `concentration_lower_bound` and `concentration_upper_bound` set the default
  concentration bounds for all other metabolites
- `concentration ratios` is a dictionary that assigns a tuple of
  metabolite-metabolite-concentration ratio constraint names; e.g. ATP/ADP
  ratio can be fixed to five-times-more-ATP by setting `concentration_ratios =
  Dict("adenosin_ratio" => ("atp", "adp", 5.0))`
- `T` and `R` default to the usual required thermodynamic constraints in the
  usual units (K and kJ/K/mol, respectively). These multiply the
  log-concentrations to obtain the actual Gibbs energies and thus driving
  forces.
