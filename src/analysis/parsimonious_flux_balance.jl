Optimize the system of `constraints` to get the optimal `objective` value. Then
try to find a "parsimonious" solution with the same `objective` value, which
optimizes the `parsimonious_objective` (possibly also switching optimization
sense, optimizer, and adding more modifications).

For efficiency, everything is performed on a single instance of JuMP model.

A simpler version suitable for direct work with metabolic models is available
in [`parsimonious_flux_balance`](@ref).

$(TYPEDSIGNATURES)

Compute a parsimonious flux solution for the given `model`. In short, the
objective value of the parsimonious solution should be the same as the one from
[`flux_balance`](@ref), except the squared sum of reaction fluxes is minimized.
If there are multiple possible fluxes that achieve a given objective value,
parsimonious flux thus represents the "minimum energy" one, thus arguably more
realistic. The optimized squared distance is present in the result as
`parsimonious_objective`.

Most arguments are forwarded to [`parsimonious_optimized_constraints`](@ref),
with some (objectives) filled in automatically to fit the common processing of
FBC models, and some (`tolerances`) provided with more practical defaults.

Similarly to the [`flux_balance`](@ref), returns a tree with the optimization
solutions of the shape as given by [`fbc_model_constraints`](@ref).
