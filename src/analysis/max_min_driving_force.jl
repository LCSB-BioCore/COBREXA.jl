Perform a max-min driving force analysis on the `model`, as defined by Noor, et al.,
"Pathway thermodynamics highlights kinetic obstacles in central metabolism.", PLoS
computational biology, 2014.

The function uses the supplied `optimizer` and `reaction_standard_gibbs_free_energies`.
Optionally, `flux_solution` can be used to set the directions of each reaction in `model`
(all reactions are assumed to proceed forward and are active by default). The supplied
`flux_solution` should be free of internal cycles i.e. thermodynamically consistent. This
optional input is important if a reaction in `model` normally runs in reverse (negative
flux). Note, reactions in `flux_solution` that are smaller than `small_flux_tol` are also
ignored in the analysis function (for numerical stability).

The max-min driving force algorithm returns the Gibbs free energy of the reactions, the
concentrations of metabolites and the actual maximum minimum driving force. The optimization
problem solved is:
```
max min -ΔᵣG
s.t. ΔᵣG = ΔrG⁰ + R T S' ln(C)
     ΔᵣG ≤ 0
     ln(Cₗ) ≤ ln(C) ≤ ln(Cᵤ)
```
where `ΔrG` are the Gibbs energies dissipated by the reactions, R is the gas constant, T is
the temperature, S is the stoichiometry of the model, and C is the vector of metabolite
concentrations (and their respective lower and upper bounds).

In case no feasible solution exists, `nothing` is returned.

Reactions specified in `ignore_reaction_ids` are internally ignored when calculating the
max-min driving force. This should include water and proton importers.

Since biochemical thermodynamics are assumed, the `proton_ids` and `water_ids` need to be
specified so that they can be ignored in the calculations. Effectively this assumes an
aqueous environment at constant pH is used.

`constant_concentrations` is used to fix the concentrations of certain metabolites (such as
CO₂). `concentration_ratios` is used to specify additional constraints on metabolite pair
concentrations (typically, this is done with various cofactors such as the ATP/ADP ratio.
For example, you can fix the concentration of ATP to be always 5× higher than of ADP by
specifying `Dict(("ATP","ADP") => 5.0)`

`concentration_lb` and `concentration_ub` set the `Cₗ` and `Cᵤ` in the
optimization problems.

`T` and `R` can be specified in the corresponding units; defaults are K and kJ/K/mol.

$(TYPEDSIGNATURES)

Perform a variant of flux variability analysis on a max min driving force type problem.
Arguments are forwarded to [`max_min_driving_force`](@ref). Calls [`screen`](@ref)
internally and possibly distributes computation across `workers`. If
`optimal_objective_value = nothing`, the function first performs regular max min driving
force analysis to find the max min driving force of the model and sets this to
`optimal_objective_value`. Then iteratively maximizes and minimizes the driving force across
each reaction, and then the concentrations while staying close to the original max min
driving force as specified in `bounds`.

The `bounds` is a user-supplied function that specifies the max min driving force bounds for
the variability optimizations, by default it restricts the flux objective value to the
precise optimum reached in the normal max min driving force analysis. It can return `-Inf`
and `Inf` in first and second pair to remove the limit. Use [`gamma_bounds`](@ref) and
[`objective_bounds`](@ref) for simple bounds.

Returns a matrix of solutions to [`max_min_driving_force`](@ref) additionally constrained as
described above, where the rows are in the order of the reactions and then the metabolites
of the `model`. For the reaction rows the first column is the maximum dG of that reaction,
and the second column is the minimum dG of that reaction subject to the above constraints.
For the metabolite rows, the first column is the maximum concentration, and the second column
is the minimum concentration subject to the constraints above.
