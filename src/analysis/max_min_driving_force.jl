$(TYPEDSIGNATURES)

Perform a max-min driving force analysis using `optimizer` on the `model` with
supplied ΔG⁰s in `reaction_standard_gibbs_free_energies`, as defined by Noor, et
al., "Pathway thermodynamics highlights kinetic obstacles in central
metabolism.", PLoS computational biology, 2014.

Optionally, `reference_flux` can be used to set the directions of each reaction
in `model` (all reactions are assumed to proceed forward by default). The
supplied `reference_flux` should be free of internal cycles i.e.
thermodynamically consistent. This optional input is important if a reaction in
`model` normally runs in reverse (negative flux). Note, only the signs are
extracted from this input, so be careful with floating point precision near 0.

The max-min driving force algorithm returns the Gibbs free energy of the
reactions, the concentrations of metabolites and the actual maximum minimum
driving force. The optimization problem solved is:
```
max min -ΔᵣG
s.t. ΔᵣG = ΔrG⁰ + R T S' ln(C)
     ΔᵣG ≤ 0
     ln(Cₗ) ≤ ln(C) ≤ ln(Cᵤ)
```
where `ΔrG` are the Gibbs energies dissipated by the reactions, R is the gas
constant, T is the temperature, S is the stoichiometry of the model, and C is
the vector of metabolite concentrations (and their respective lower and upper
bounds).

In case no feasible solution exists, `nothing` is returned.

Reactions specified in `ignore_reaction_ids` are internally ignored when
calculating the max-min driving force. Importantly, this should include water
and proton importers.

Since biochemical thermodynamics are assumed, the `proton_ids` and `water_ids`
need to be specified so that they can be ignored in the calculations.
Effectively this assumes an aqueous environment at constant pH is used.

`constant_concentrations` is used to fix the concentrations of certain
metabolites (such as CO₂) by passing a dictionary mapping metabolite id to its
constant value. `concentration_ratios` is used to specify additional constraints
on metabolite pair concentrations (typically, this is done with various
cofactors, such as the ATP/ADP ratio. For example, you can fix the concentration
of ATP to be always 5× higher than of ADP by specifying `Dict("atp_ratio" =>
("atp_c","adp_c", 5.0))` if these metabolites are called `atp_c` and `adp_c` in
the model. `concentration_lb` and `concentration_ub` set the `Cₗ` and `Cᵤ` in
the optimization problems (these are overwritten by `constant_concentrations` if
supplied).

`T` and `R` can be specified in the corresponding units; defaults are K and
kJ/K/mol. The unit of metabolite concentrations is typically molar. As usual,
optimizer settings can be changed with `modifications`.

Returns a tree with the optimization solution or `nothing` if the model cannot
be solved.
